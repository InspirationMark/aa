It is very important to design an intelligent greenhouse automatic monitoring and control system. The automatic control system based on PLC realizes real-time monitoring of illumination intensity, temperature, carbon dioxide concentration and other parameters. Data transmission and control are realized based on ethernet. The system has simple structure and stable operation. Through field application test, the system can meet the needs of users and greatly improve the management efficiency of greenhouse.</p><p><strong>Keywords  </strong>Ethernet; PLC; Intelligent Greenhouse; Automatic Control</p><p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p><p>Modern agriculture is developing more and more towards   refinement   and    scale.    Cloud   platform monitoring  technology  is  an  important  support  for realizing   agricultural   intensive,   high   yield,   high quality,  high  efficiency,  ecology  and   security.  At present,  it  is  mainly  applied  to  the  perception  and regulation of field information. It provides a basis for scientific  management  of agriculture,  so  as  to  take appropriate  management   measures  in  time,   adjust production  factors,  make  them  meet  the  needs  of efficient crop growth, and improve the efficiency of agricultural  production.  The  intelligent  agricultural greenhouse   monitoring   system   supporting   multi- platform application is designed in document 1. The system  realizes  remote   data   acquisition,  but   the control  of  production  parameters  in  greenhouse  is inadequate. The emphasis is on a monitoring role in greenhouse.     In     Document     2,     an     intelligent agricultural greenhouse system based on Internet of Things cloud platform is designed. The disadvantage is that it can only send alerts to users through short messages  on  mobile  phones.  This  paper  designs  a monitoring    and    control    system    of    Intelligent Greenhouse   Based    on   PLC,    which   can    detect production  factors  such  as  temperature,  humidity, light,  moisture,  carbon  dioxide  concentration,  and obtain  image  information  of crop  growth,  so  as  to understand crops in time.</p><p>Growth  status,  soil  fertility  and pest  and  disease status provide the basis for scientific management of agriculture, so as to timely adjust production factors and meet the growth needs of crops. It also realizes high-scale,  intensive  and  industrialized  agricultural production,   improves   the   ability   of   agricultural production to cope with natural environmental risks, and makes the disadvantaged traditional agriculture a modern industry with high efficiency.</p><p>The Intelligent Greenhouse Monitoring and control system   based   on   PLC   consists   of   three   parts: information-acquisition-system,                information processing system and regulation system. Firstly, the information     acquisition     system     collects     the parameters in greenhouse, uploads the information to the  information  processing  system  equipped  with PLC, sets the specific range of relevant parameters on the    information    processing    system,    when    the parameters   of   production   factors   in   greenhouse exceed the range, the information processing system uploads   to   the   regulation   system   to   adjust   the parameters that need to be adjusted.</p><p><strong>MODULE DESIGN</strong></p><p><strong>Design of Information Acquisition</strong></p><p>Information     acquisition     system.     The     main parameters  determining  crop  production  status  are atmospheric temperature  and humidity, illumination and soil temperature and humidity. The information acquisition  system  collects  temperature,  humidity, illumination intensity, soil temperature and humidity information  in  greenhouse  through  the  sensors  of atmospheric temperature  and humidity, illumination intensity   and   soil   temperature   and   humidity   in greenhouse,    and   transmits   real-time   production factors information to PLC. Real-time information is displayed by touch screen and PC. The RS-485 bus mode is used to collect the information of production factors     such     as     temperature     and     humidity, illumination,   soil   temperature    and   humidity    in greenhouse. It does not occupy the control point of the controller, and I/O points are all from the control of the regulating equipment.</p><p>Crop breeding is the most common and common planting technology in agricultural production. It has remarkable   effect   in   improving   crop   yield   and immunity. The application of seedling technology is</p><p>to  cultivate  fruits  and  vegetables  in  Greenhouse  in advance,   shorten   their   growth   cycle,   obtain   the excellent  species  needed  in  seasonal  market,  and increase the added value of products.  Sensors have also  been  widely  used  in  the  process  of  seedling cultivation. Its main function is to collect and detect various  parameters  in  the  environment  of  seedling cultivation,      including      temperature,      humidity, illumination, carbon dioxide content and other major data,  and  then  transmit  them  to  the  main  control computer      instrument,     thereby     realizing     the adjustment   of   various   environmental   conditions. [Yang Jianmin, Yang Qingmei 2005.10]</p><p>The main parameters determining crop production status  are  atmospheric  temperature  and  humidity, illumination and soil temperature and humidity. The information acquisition system collects temperature, humidity, illumination intensity, soil temperature and humidity   information   in   greenhouse   through   the sensors  of  atmospheric  temperature  and  humidity, illumination   intensity    and   soil    temperature   and humidity   in   greenhouse,   and   transmits   real-time production  factors  information  to   PLC.  Real-time information is displayed by touch screen and PC.</p><p><strong>Information Processing Design</strong></p><p>Information processing  system.  The  controller  is mainly    responsible    for    monitoring    greenhouse temperature, humidity, illumination, soil temperature, humidity   and   other   environmental   indicators.   Its parameter         adjustment          mainly         provides communication  interface  for remote  control  system through  field  control  and  adjustment  of  fan,  water pump  and  humidifier  connected  with  the  control system.  Because  of  the  bus  mode  of  information acquisition  and  the  need  for  remote  control,  the controller      must      have      bus      and      Ethernet communication  interface.   Considering  the  control points     and     communication     requirements,     the controller chooses Siemens S7-200 series 224XP and Ethernet expansion module CP243-1, which provide two   serial  ports.   The   development   of  intelligent sensor networks is the key to achieve successful and sustainable control. This paper presents a method to develop this kind of network by using the possibility of   programmable    logic    controller.    [Atanas    N. Iovev,Peter 2015.4.8]</p><p>Considering the  complexity  of field  control, two control modes, automatic and manual, are designed. Manual  control  is realized by manual touch  screen and   upper   computer.   The    automatic   mode   is controlled  by  controller   according  to  the   setting values  of  atmospheric  temperature   and  humidity, illumination and soil temperature and humidity, so as to realize automatic control of production factors.</p><p>The  RS-485  bus  mode  is  used  to  collect  the information of production factors such as temperature and   humidity,   illumination,   soil   temperature   and humidity  in  greenhouse.  It  does  not  occupy  the control point of the controller, and I/O points are all from the control of the regulating equipment.</p><p>The air switch and fuse are set, and the fuse is set for the output of DC power  supply, so as to ensure the safety and stability of power supply.</p><p><strong>Adjustment design</strong></p><p>1. Adjustment of temperature and light intensity. In order to improve the temperature and illumination intensity in greenhouse, the plane mirror is used to reflect sunlight, and the temperature and illumination intensity in greenhouse are adjusted by adjusting the angle of the plane mirror reflection. A plane mirror is installed  outside  the   greenhouse.  The   axis  of  the plane  mirror  is  connected  with  the  stepping  motor and the  stepping motor is connected with the PLC. When  the  temperature   drops,  the   information   is uploaded to the PLC, which makes the stepper motor electrify, the stepper motor rotates, and changes the angle of the plane mirror, so that the temperature and light intensity in the greenhouse rise.</p><p>2. Adjustment of shading. Install the motor on the upper part of the  greenhouse, roll the straw mat on the outside of the motor,  control the motor forward and backward by PLC. When the motor is in positive rotation, the straw mat is put down to keep warm and shade the sun. When the motor is in reverse, the straw mat will be put away.</p><p>3. Humidity regulation. Pumps are installed in the greenhouse,  and  water  pumps  are  connected  with sprinklers through  water pipes. When the  humidity detected  by  humidity   sensors   in  the   greenhouse decreases,  the  PLC  is  uploaded  to  make  the  water pumped electrically and sprayed through the sprinkler head, which not only increases the humidity in the greenhouse, but also supplements the moisture of the soil.</p><p>4.     Regulation     of     ventilation.     When     the concentration  of  carbon  dioxide  is  lower  than  the compensation  point  of crops,  the  fans  installed  on both  sides  of  the  greenhouse  begin  to  rotate  and exchange  with  the  outside  gases.  But  when  the outside    temperature    is    lower    than    a    certain temperature, the temperature sensor uploads the PLC, which cuts off the fan and stops ventilation.

module 2 and regulation module 3. Monitoring module  1 includes temperature  monitor  11,  humidity  monitor   12  and illumination   monitor    13.   Regulation   module   3 includes motor 31, water pump 32, sprinkler 33, fan 34, flat mirror 35 and straw mat 36. Control module 2 receives  the  monitoring  information  of  monitoring module   1.  Control  module   2  analyses  whether   it meets the requirements according to the monitoring information  and  sends  control  signals  to  regulation module 3. Temperature monitor 11, humidity monitor 12  and  illumination  monitor   13  are  distributed  in greenhouses. The motor 31 drives the  grass mat to rotate and retrieve. The grass mat 36 can set the top of  the   word   greenhouse   4   to   adjust   the   light transmission   and  heat  preservation   effect   of  the greenhouse 4. The motor 31 drives the plane mirror 35  to  rotate,  thus  changing  the  illumination  of the greenhouse. The pump 32 is connected with multiple sprinklers 33, which are arranged in the greenhouse 4 through a bracket. The top and side of the greenhouse 4 are equipped with a plane mirror 35, and the fan 34 is set on the side wall of the greenhouse 4. There are more than 35 planar mirrors. The motor 31 drives the planar  mirror  to  rotate  360  degrees,  so  that  the illumination in the greenhouse can be changed from many angles. In addition, a temperature monitor is set at the entrance of the fan, and an electric heating wire is set in the duct of the fan 34. In order to prevent the temperature of the greenhouse from being affected in the  process  of ventilation,  the  fan  34  with  electric heating wire is used to ventilate the greenhouse by means   of   pressurized   ventilation   to    ensure   the concentration of CO2 in the room.</p><p>Example 2</p><p>On  the  basis  of  implementation  example   1,  the specific   structure   of   greenhouse   monitoring   and control system is further explained.</p><p>Greenhouse    monitoring    and    control     system  includes monitoring module 1, control module 2 and  regulation    module    3.    The    monitoring    module  includes  temperature  monitor  11,  humidity  monitor  12 and illumination monitor 13. The main parameters  of temperature  and  humidity,  illumination  and  soil  temperature    and    humidity    in    greenhouse    are  determined.  Through  the  humidity  detector   12  in  greenhouse,    illumination    detector    13    and    soil  temperature and humidity detector 11 buried in soil.  The      information      of     temperature,     humidity,  illumination intensity, soil temperature and humidity  in   greenhouse   were   collected,   and   the   real-time  production factor information was transmitted to PLC, and  real-time  information  was  displayed  by  touch  screen  and  PC.  The  RS-485  bus  mode  is  used  to  collect the information of production factors such as  temperature     and     humidity,     illumination,     soil  temperature and humidity in greenhouse. It does not  occupy the  control point  of the  controller,  and  I/O</p><p>points  are  all  from  the   control  of  the  regulating equipment.   When   the   parameters   of   factors   of production in greenhouse exceed the  scope, control module 2 sends out control signals to the regulation module  to  adjust  the  parameters  that  need  to  be adjusted.</p><p>Monitoring module 1 adopts bus connection mode and  can  realize  remote  control.  Control  module  2 must have bus and Ethernet communication interface. Considering  the  control  point  and  communication requirements, control module 2 chooses Siemens S7- 200  series  224XP  and  Ethernet  expansion  module CP243-1, which provide two serial ports.</p><p>In    order    to    improve    the    temperature    and illumination intensity in greenhouse, the plane mirror is  used  to  reflect  sunlight.  The  temperature  and illumination intensity in greenhouse are adjusted by adjusting  the  angle  of  the  plane  mirror.  A  plane mirror is installed outside the greenhouse. The axis of the plane  mirror  35  is connected with the  stepping motor and the stepping motor is connected with the PLC.  Plane  mirror  is  used  to  adjust  the  width  of daytime in the greenhouse so as to ensure the stability of   illumination    in   the    greenhouse.   When   the temperature      or      illumination      decreases,      the information  is  uploaded  to  PLC,  which  makes  the stepper motor electrify, the stepper motor rotates, and changes  the   angle  of  the  plane  mirror,  so  as  to increase the temperature and illumination intensity in the greenhouse. In addition, a motor is installed on the upper part of greenhouse 4, and the straw mat 36 is rolled on the outer part of the motor. The motor is controlled  by  PLC  to  turn  forward  and  backward. When the motor rotates forward, the straw mat 36 is put down to keep warm and shade the sun. When the motor rotates backward,  the  straw  mat  will be put away.</p><p>The  system  adjusts  the  humidity  by  installing pumps  in  greenhouse.  Pump  32  is  connected  with sprinkler  33  through  water  pipe.  Sprinkler  33  is installed on the indoor bracket. When the humidity detected   by   humidity    sensor   in   greenhouse   4 decreases, it is uploaded to PLC, so that pump 32 can be pumped by electricity and  sprinkled out through sprinkler head, which not only increases the humidity in greenhouse, but also supplements the moisture of soil.   Temperature,   humidity   and   illumination   in greenhouse  are  monitored  by  monitoring   module. According to the monitoring results, control module 2 sends out control instructions, receives and puts grass mat or adjusts the angle of plane mirror, and adjusts sprinkler head to control humidity.</p><p>In addition, monitoring module  1 can also set up carbon   dioxide   concentration   monitoring  module. When the carbon dioxide concentration is lower than the compensation point of crops, the fans installed on both  sides  of  the  greenhouse  begin  to  rotate  and exchange with the outside gas. But when the outside temperature is lower than a certain temperature, the temperature  sensor  is  uploaded  to  the  PLC,  which will turn on the hot wire in the fan duct to ensure the</p><p>temperature of the air, and make the temperature of the air flowing into the greenhouse. Carbon dioxide in greenhouses is replenished.</p><p>36</p><p>35</p><p>4</p><p>34</p><p>Fig 2 the structure diagram of greenhouse control system.</p><p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p><p>In view of the low popularization rate of Intelligent  Greenhouse    in    China    and    the    constraints    of  production cost, this research is seldom adopted by  individual and general farmers. The greenhouse used  by farmers is simple in structure, simple in equipment, difficult  to   achieve   comprehensive   environmental  control, production management and operation level  is relatively low and  other  conditions.  Through the  monitoring system of cloud platform, the detection of  factors   of  production   such   as   soil   fertility,   soil  temperature  and  humidity,  atmospheric  temperature  and     humidity,     light,     water,     carbon     dioxide  concentration     and     the     acquisition     of    image  information of crop growth are carried out. Through  collecting  environmental  information  and  real-time  monitoring of crop growth, the growth status of crops, soil  fertility  and  pests  and  diseases  can  be  timely</p><p>understood,     and      scientific     management      for agriculture can be carried out. In order to adjust the production factors in time and meet the growth needs of  crops,   we   have   also   realized   the   high-scale, intensive  and  industrialized  agricultural  production, improved  the  ability  of  agricultural  production  to cope with natural environmental risks, and made the disadvantaged    traditional    agriculture    a    modern industry with high efficiency.</p><p><strong>REFERENCES</strong></p><p>Atanas N.
